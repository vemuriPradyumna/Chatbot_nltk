# Chatbot_nltk
A simple chatbot using nltk and keras.
This simple chatbot is based on a pre-defined set of patterns, consisting of questions and the respective responses. Also, similar patterns of questions are grouped by 'tags'.
For each tag, the model builds a bag of words and creates a dataset to train the Neural Network.
